## STATEC Hackathon 2025

**An aging population ‚Äî but can everyone access key services?**

---

### üß≠ Overview
An interactive map allowing you to see at a glance the location of service providers for the elderly in combination with the population density by municipality of the to-be-discussed age ranges in Luxembourg.

### **Problem Statement**

- Data on elderly populations and local services is scattered across multiple sources, making analysis and planning difficult.  
- Policymakers and communities lack a unified view of how well services meet the needs of residents aged 65+.  
- There is no simple, interactive tool to visualize demographic and service data across municipalities.  
- This limits data-driven decisions in healthcare access, social inclusion, and urban planning.  

**Solution:**  
An **interactive web map** built with open government data and geospatial tools, showing:  
- üëµ Share of residents 65+ (with gender distribution)  
- üíä Pharmacies  
- üè• Hospitals  
- ü§ù Senior clubs  

- Possibilities for further extension: access to green areas, GP offices, physiotherapists, activities, etc. 

This tool integrates key public datasets to support smarter, more equitable planning for aging populations.

**Intended audience**
- Senior citizens and their family members (to see locations of key services)
- People of any age planning their retirement (for example to purchase retirement property)
- Policy makers to get a quick view on distribution and availability of key services.

### Instructions to visualize the dashboard

- clone the repository and save it in a directoy (e.g. 'your_repo_dir_path')
    - you can download it manually:
    - or, with git, run in command line:
        - cd 'your_repo_dir_path' (to set your directory path)
        - git clone https://github.com/xkamphaus/STATEC_hackathon_2025.git (to save all repo files in your directory)

- install python (saved in 'your_python_dir_path')

- run in command line:
    - cd 'your_repo_dir_path'/statec_hackathon_2025/ (to set the directory where the repository is cloned)
    - 'your_python_dir_path'/python.exe -m http.server 8000 (this opens the instance to host the website locally)

- open a webbrowser and go to the url: http://127.0.0.1:8000/
