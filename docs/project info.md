### **Problem Statement**

- Data on elderly populations and local services is scattered across multiple sources, making analysis and planning difficult.  
- Policymakers and communities lack a unified view of how well services meet the needs of residents aged 65+.  
- There is no simple, interactive tool to visualize demographic and service data across municipalities.  
- This limits data-driven decisions in healthcare access, social inclusion, and urban planning.  

**Solution:**  
An **interactive web map** built with open government data and geospatial tools, showing:  
- 👵 Share of residents 65+ (with gender distribution)  
- 💊 Pharmacies  
- 🏥 Hospitals  
- 🤝 Senior clubs  

- Possibilities for further extension: access to green areas, GP offices, physiotherapists, etc. 

This tool integrates key public datasets to support smarter, more equitable planning for aging populations.


### 💭 Intended audience 
- Senior citizens and their family members (to see locations of key services)
- People of any age planning their retirement (for example to purchase retirement property)
- Policy makers to get a quick view on distribution and availability of key services.

### Technical aspects 

- Data sources: Government open data (population, services)​

- Development tools:​

--Mapping: Leaflet / Mapbox​

--Data processing: Python / R​

--Front-end: HTML/CSS/JavaScript (if interactive web app)​

- Innovation:​

First map in Luxembourg combining age distribution + service locations​

Easy to expand (add more services, filters, or metrics)​

### Why the Map Matters & What’s Next​

- Policy information

--Identify underserved areas → support planning​

--Improve accessibility for seniors​

- Future possibilities:​

--Add public transport routes, community centers​

--Predictive modeling for population aging trends​

--Mobile-friendly interface for citizens
